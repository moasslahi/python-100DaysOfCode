# Day 10 python operators
#Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
x = 10
y = 5
#Arithmetic operators 
print(x + y) #  Addition 
print(x - y) #  Substraction 
print(x * y) #  Multiplication
print(x / y) #  Division 
print(x % y) #  Modulus 
print(x ** y)#  Exponentiation 
print(x // y)#  Floor divisin

#comparison operators 
print(x == y) # Equal 
print(x != y) # Not Equal 
print(x > y)  # Greater than 
print(x < y)  # Less than 
print(x >= y) # Greater than or equal to
print(x <= y) # Less than or equal to
